# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code
#print ("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")

print("The # (octothorpe) within a string will be printed.")

# In this exercise we also learned to read code backwards.
# This way, we process it differently,
#   and focus on actually reading each line.
#   Rather than filling in the gaps with our mind.
